# Developing Neutrino

Developing and contributing to Neutrino, its core presets, and middleware is done through our monorepo located at
https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev. The code is broken up into a couple different sections:
packages and documentation.

_Note: In this guide, commands executable from the command line are prepended with `‚ùØ`. Lines not starting
with this symbol show sample console output from running the previous command._

## Requirements

Developing for neutrino-dev requires:

- Node.js v6 LTS, v8, v9
- Yarn v1.2.1+, installation instructions at https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
- git, GitHub account

## Getting started

The first step to start developing neutrino-dev is
[forking the repository to your own GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

<a href="https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev/fork" target="_blank">Fork mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev on GitHub</a>

Once that is done, you can clone your copy of the repository on your computer, replacing `USER` with the username
of the account you forked the repository to:

```bash
‚ùØ git clone git@github.com:USER/neutrino-dev.git
‚ùØ cd neutrino-dev
```

Upon cloning, you should install dependencies:

```bash
‚ùØ yarn
```

This uses the yarn workspaces feature to create symlinks between the various packages, simplifying local development.

## Development commands

The package.json for neutrino-dev defines several commands to assist in the development and deployment process.

---

`link:all`

Runs `yarn link` against all packages in the neutrino-dev monorepo. This allows you to run `yarn link <package>`
anywhere on your system for neutrino-dev packages, making testing of the packages simpler in local projects.

```bash
‚ùØ yarn link:all

# Elsewhere on your system
‚ùØ yarn link @neutrinojs/react
```

---

`changelog`

Generates a changelog for the `mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev` GitHub repository. This changelog is output to a
`CHANGELOG.md` file in the root of the repository.

```bash
‚ùØ yarn changelog
```

---

`docs:serve`

Starts a local development server which builds the documentation in `docs` to a gitbook running on port 4000.

```bash
‚ùØ yarn docs:serve
```

---

`docs:build`

Generates a static site by building the documentation in `docs` to a gitbook to the `_book` directory.

```bash
‚ùØ yarn docs:build
```

---

`docs:deploy`

Generates a static site by building the documentation in `docs` to a gitbook to the `_book` directory, then pushing the
contents of `_book` to a `gh-pages` branch on GitHub. In order to run this command, you must have an `upstream` remote
configured pointing to the root neutrino-dev repo, and have sufficient rights to push to the repository.

```bash
‚ùØ yarn docs:deploy
```

## Making changes

When you make changes to neutrino-dev, you should make them in a branch separate from `master`. Start from the
master branch and create a new branch for your changes.

_Example: You want to create a core preset for JavaScript Standard Style. You need a new branch for this work._

```bash
‚ùØ git checkout -b standard-style
Switched to a new branch 'standard-style'
```

While making changes, be sure to test your code out for expected operation. If possible or applicable, write a
test that can verify these changes in the future.

## Submitting a pull request

Once you are satisfied with your changes, you should commit them and submit a pull request. Use `git add`
in order to add files that should be committed. Give your changes a descriptive but not overly verbose message.

```bash
‚ùØ git add .
‚ùØ git commit -m "Feature: Adding new core preset for JavaScript Standard Style"
‚ùØ git push origin standard-style
```

Now if you open the GitHub page for your repository, GitHub should display a button to open a pull request for
the branch and commit you just pushed. When filling out the details of the pull request, try to be as descriptive
as possible, following our detailed [contribution guidelines](./README.md).

### Congrats!

You just made a contribution to Neutrino! We are so happy to have your help! üéâ

## Receiving updates

If you need to update your local copy of neutrino-dev to be in sync with the main neutrino-dev repository, you
will want to fetch upstream changes. Add the main neutrino-dev repo as an upstream to your local copy, then fetch
the latest changes from the master branch.

```bash
‚ùØ git checkout master
‚ùØ git remote add upstream https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev.git
‚ùØ git pull upstream master
```
