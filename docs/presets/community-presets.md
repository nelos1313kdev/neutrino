# Community Presets

A collection of Neutrino presets published on npm. In order to have your preset show up in this list, it must:

- Be published to npm
- Contain the `neutrino-preset` keyword in package.json
- Not be deprecated

It should also have a relevant description. If you prefer, you can also add your preset to the
[neutrino-dev wiki](https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev/wiki/Community-Presets).

{% npmsearchlist "keywords:neutrino-preset+not:deprecated" %}{% endnpmsearchlist %}
