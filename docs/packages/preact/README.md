## Features

- Zero upfront configuration necessary to start developing and building a Preact web app
- Modern Babel compilation adding JSX, object rest spread syntax, and class properties.
- Write JSX in .js or .jsx files
- Automatic import of `Preact.h`, no need to import `h` or `createElement` yourself
- Compatibility and pre-configured aliasing for React-based modules and packages
- Extends from [@neutrinojs/web](../web)
  - Modern Babel compilation supporting ES modules, last 2 major browser versions, async functions, and dynamic imports
  - webpack loaders for importing HTML, CSS, images, icons, fonts, and web workers
  - webpack Dev Server during development
  - Automatic creation of HTML pages, no templating necessary
  - Automatic stylesheet extraction; importing stylesheets into modules creates bundled external stylesheets
  - Pre-configured to support CSS Modules via `*.module.css` file extensions
  - Hot Module Replacement support including CSS
  - Tree-shaking to create smaller bundles
  - Production-optimized bundles with Babel minification, easy chunking, and scope-hoisted modules for faster execution
  - Easily extensible to customize your project as needed

## Requirements

- Node.js v6.10+
- Yarn or npm client
- Neutrino v8

## Installation

`@neutrinojs/preact` can be installed via the Yarn or npm clients. Inside your project, make sure
`neutrino` and `@neutrinojs/preact` are development dependencies. You will also need `preact` for actual
Preact development.

#### Yarn

```bash
❯ yarn add --dev neutrino @neutrinojs/preact
❯ yarn add preact
```

#### npm

```bash
❯ npm install --save-dev neutrino @neutrinojs/preact
❯ npm install --save preact
```

If you want to import React-based modules or packages, you should also install the `preact-compat`
compatibility layer:

#### Yarn

```bash
❯ yarn add preact-compat
```

#### npm

```bash
❯ npm install --save preact-compat
```

## Project Layout

`@neutrinojs/preact` follows the standard [project layout](../../project-layout) specified by Neutrino. This
means that by default all project source code should live in a directory named `src` in the root of the
project. This includes JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, images, and any other assets that would be available
to import your compiled project.

## Quickstart

After installing Neutrino and the Preact preset, add a new directory named `src` in the root of the project, with
a single JS file named `index.js` in it.

```bash
❯ mkdir src && touch src/index.js
```

This Preact preset exposes an element in the page with an ID of `root` to which you can mount your application. Edit
your `src/index.js` file with the following:

```jsx
import { render } from 'preact';

render(<h1>Hello world!</h1>, document.getElementById('root'));
```

Now edit your project's package.json to add commands for starting and building the application:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "neutrino start --use @neutrinojs/preact",
    "build": "neutrino build --use @neutrinojs/preact"
  }
}
```

If you are using `.neutrinorc.js`, add this preset to your use array instead of `--use` flags:

```js
module.exports = {
  use: ['@neutrinojs/preact']
};
```

Start the app, then open a browser to the address in the console:

#### Yarn

```bash
❯ yarn start
✔ Development server running on: http://localhost:5000
✔ Build completed
```

#### npm

```bash
❯ npm start
✔ Development server running on: http://localhost:5000
✔ Build completed
```

## Building

`@neutrinojs/preact` builds static assets to the `build` directory by default when running `neutrino build`. Using
the quick start example above as a reference:

```bash
❯ yarn build

✔ Building project completed
Hash: b26ff013b5a2d5f7b824

                           Asset       Size    Chunks             Chunk Names

                      index.html  846 bytes            [emitted]
✨  Done in 4.62s.
```

You can either serve or deploy the contents of this `build` directory as a static site.

## Static assets

If you wish to copy files to the build directory that are not imported from application code, you can place
them in a directory within `src` called `static`. All files in this directory will be copied from `src/static`
to `build/static`. To change this behavior, specify your own patterns with
[@neutrinojs/copy](../copy).

## Paths

The `@neutrinojs/preact` preset loads assets relative to the path of your application by setting webpack's
[`output.publicPath`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-publicpath) to `./`. If you wish to load
assets instead from a CDN, or if you wish to change to an absolute path for your application, customize your build to
override `output.publicPath`. See the [Customizing](#Customizing) section below.

## Preset options

You can provide custom options and have them merged with this preset's default options to easily affect how this
preset builds. You can modify Preact preset settings from `.neutrinorc.js` by overriding with an options object. Use
an array pair instead of a string to supply these options in `.neutrinorc.js`.

The following shows how you can pass an options object to the Preact preset and override its options. See the
[Web documentation](../web#preset-options) for specific options you can override with this object.

```js
module.exports = {
  use: [
    ['@neutrinojs/preact', {
      /* preset options */

      // Example: disable Hot Module Replacement
      hot: false,

      // Example: change the page title
      html: {
        title: 'Epic Preact App'
      },

      // Target specific browsers with babel-preset-env
      targets: {
        browsers: [
          'last 1 Chrome versions',
          'last 1 Firefox versions'
        ]
      },

      // Add additional Babel plugins, presets, or env options
      babel: {
        // Override options for babel-preset-env:
        presets: [
          ['babel-preset-env', {
            modules: false,
            useBuiltIns: true,
            exclude: ['transform-regenerator', 'transform-async-to-generator'],
          }]
        ]
      }
    }]
  ]
};
```

## Customizing

To override the build configuration, start with the documentation on [customization](../../customization).
`@neutrinojs/preact` does not use any additional named rules, loaders, or plugins that aren't already in use by the
Web preset. See the [Web documentation customization](../web#customizing)
for preset-specific configuration to override.

### Advanced configuration

By following the [customization guide](../../customization) and knowing the rule, loader, and plugin IDs from
`@neutrinojs/web`, you can override and augment the build by providing a function to your `.neutrinorc.js` use
array. You can also make these changes from the Neutrino API in custom middleware.

#### Vendoring

By defining an entry point named `vendor` you can split out external dependencies into a chunk separate
from your application code.

_Example: Put Preact into a separate "vendor" chunk:_

```js
module.exports = {
  use: [
    '@neutrinojs/preact',
    (neutrino) => {
      neutrino.config
        .entry('vendor')
          .add('preact');
    }
  ]
};
```

## Hot Module Replacement

While `@neutrinojs/preact` supports Hot Module Replacement, it does require some
application-specific changes in order to operate.

- Perform the application render in a reusable function for initial load and subsequent reloads.
- Add the `hot` acceptance to call this function.

For example:

```jsx
import { render } from 'preact';
import App from './App';

let mount;
const root = document.getElementById('root');
const load = (App) => {
  mount = render(<App />, root, mount);
};
 
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('./App', () => requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    load(require('./App').default);
  ));
}
 
load(App);
```

## Preact Devtools

To use the React Devtools for your Preact project, require the preact devtools during the `development` environment
within your main entry file (typically `src/index`):

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  require('preact/devtools');
} 
```
