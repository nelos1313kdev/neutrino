# Neutrino CLI

Using the command-line interface is the preferred and simplest way of interacting with Neutrino.

When using the Neutrino CLI, you can provide a list of middleware for the API to attempt to load and merge
configurations. Each middleware will attempt to be loaded from the current working directory's `node_modules`, nested
within, by name, or relative file path. If it cannot be found, an exception will be thrown. In addition to any provided
middleware, Neutrino will attempt to load a `.neutrinorc.js` file as middleware from the current working directory if
it exists.

Let's take a look at the CLI usage.

## `--help`

Using `neutrino --help` will bring up the following help guide:

```bash
❯ neutrino --help
Commands:
  start           Build a project in development mode
  build           Compile the source directory to a bundled build
  test [files..]  Run all suites from the test directory or provided files

Options:
  --inspect  Output a string representation of the configuration used by webpack and exit                     [boolean] [default: false]
  --use      A list of Neutrino middleware used to configure the build                                        [array] [default: []]
  --options  Set Neutrino options, config, and environment variables, e.g. --options.env.NODE_ENV production  [default: {}]
  --quiet    Disable console output of CLI commands                                                           [boolean] [default: false]
  --debug    Run in debug mode                                                                                [boolean] [default: false]
  --require  Preload a module prior to loading Neutrino; can be used multiple times                           [array] [default: []]
  --version  Show version number                                                                              [boolean]
  --help     Show help                                                                                        [boolean]
```

## `--version`

Using `--version` will output the current version of the Neutrino CLI to the console and exit.

```bash
❯ neutrino --version
7.0.0
```

## `--use`

The `--use` flag can be used in conjunction with any of the top-level commands to specify a collection of
middleware and presets to load. These can be an npm package or a relative path to a module to load as middleware.

```bash
❯ neutrino start --use @neutrinojs/react @neutrinojs/karma
```

The Neutrino CLI will still attempt to load any presets and middleware defined in the project's `.neutrinorc.js` file.
Middleware passed via the CLI `--use` will take precedence over middleware defined in `.neutrinorc.js`, meaning that
options set by `.neutrinorc.js` middleware can have their values overridden by `--use` middleware.

## `--inspect`

The `--inspect` flag can be used to write out a stringified version of the Webpack configuration which has been
accumulated by all middleware. When using the `--inspect` flag, the Neutrino CLI will still import all presets and
middleware that have been supplied, but will then exit after logging the configuration to stdout. No builds, servers, or
watchers will be started.

```bash
❯ neutrino start --inspect --use @neutrinojs/react @neutrinojs/jest
```

This could also be used to help create diffs between configuration changes. Take the following command:

```bash
❯ neutrino start --inspect --use @neutrinojs/react @neutrinojs/jest
```

We can capture this inspection to a file, and capture the change by adding a preset override:

```bash
❯ neutrino start --inspect --use @neutrinojs/react @neutrinojs/jest > a.config
❯ neutrino start --inspect --use @neutrinojs/react @neutrinojs/jest override.js > b.config
```

Using `git diff a.config b.config`, we get a pretty diff of the configuration change:

```diff
diff --git a/a.config b/b.config
index 3356802..d4d82ef 100644
--- a/a.config
+++ b/b.config
@@ -3,6 +3,7 @@
   devtool: 'source-map',
   entry: {
     index: [
+      'babel-polyfill',
       '/node/src/index.js'
     ]
   },
```

## --require

Require one or more modules prior to invoking any Neutrino commands. These can be an npm package or a relative path to
a module to require. If you export a function, Neutrino will execute this function for you. If you export a Promise, or
if you export a function that returns a Promise, Neutrino will wait for it to resolve before invoking any commands.
Using `--require` with multiple Promise-using modules will make Neutrino await all the Promises in parallel prior to
running a command.

The `--require` flag can be especially useful if you need to perform work before running Neutrino each time.

```bash
❯ neutrino start --require load-env.js

❯ neutrino build --require scripts/load-env scripts/fetch-remote-data

❯ neutrino build --require scripts/load-env --require scripts/fetch-remote-data
```

## --debug

Informs interested middleware that they should be in a state of debugging. This does not currently make Neutrino itself
behave any differently; rather it can be used to inform middleware to behave differently, by outputting console
information, inspecting processes, or changing configuration helpful for debugging.

## --quiet

Prevents the CLI from outputting any console output. Neutrino middleware should also respect this flag when possible,
but is not a guarantee.

## --options

Used to override Neutrino options, configuration, and environments from the command line. This would typically be used
for specifying one-off changes that may not be appropriate to encapsulate in `.neutrinorc.js`. The `--options` flag is
formatted as "dotted-object" syntax, meaning it should be used as `--options.<option> [value]`. This can also be used
to toggle Boolean options to `true` by providing no value. Some examples:

```bash
❯ neutrino start --options.host 192.168.1.10 --options.port 3000

❯ neutrino build --options.env.NODE_ENV development --options.env.CUSTOM_ENV_VAR customValue

# Sets options.https to true
❯ neutrino start --options.https

❯ neutrino start --options.config.devtool eval

# Sets config.node.Buffer to true
❯ neutrino start --options.config.node.Buffer
```

## `neutrino start`

Using the command `neutrino start` builds a project in development mode, also starting a development server or source
watcher depending on the middleware or configuration used. This command sets the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to
`development` by default.

## `neutrino build`

Using the command `neutrino build` builds a project in production mode, rendering static assets to the configured build
output destination. This command sets the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production` by default.

## `neutrino test`

Using the command `neutrino test` passes execution onto a test runner preset. It is up to the preset or middleware being
used to determine how source files are built or provided to tests. See your particular test middleware for details. This
command sets the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `test` by default.

Looking at the `--help` for `neutrino test`:

```bash
❯ neutrino test --help
neutrino test [files..]

Options:
  --inspect   Output a string representation of the configuration used by Neutrino and exit                    [boolean] [default: false]
  --use       A list of Neutrino middleware used to configure the build                                        [array] [default: []]
  --options   Set Neutrino options, config, and environment variables, e.g. --options.env.NODE_ENV production  [default: {}]
  --quiet     Disable console output of CLI commands                                                           [boolean] [default: false]
  --debug     Run in debug mode                                                                                [boolean] [default: false]
  --version   Show version number                                                                              [boolean]
  --help      Show help                                                                                        [boolean]
  --coverage  Collect test coverage information and generate report                                            [boolean] [default: false]
  --watch     Watch source files for changes and re-run tests                                                  [boolean] [default: false]
```

Using the command `neutrino test` will execute every test file located in your
[testing directory](../project-layout#Testing). You may also provide to this command the specific test files you wish
to run individually. It is important to note that when combined with the `--use` parameter, you should use two
dashes after the last preset to denote the end of the presets and the beginning of the test files.

```bash
❯ neutrino test a_test.js b_test.js
```

```bash
❯ neutrino test --use @neutrinojs/react @neutrinojs/karma -- a_test.js b_test.js
```

You can also pass a flag `--watch` to watch source files for changes and re-run tests, if your middleware supports it.

```bash
❯ neutrino test --watch
```

As well, you can pass a flag `--coverage` to collect test coverage information and generate a report, if your middleware
supports it.

```bash
❯ neutrino test --coverage
```

## Custom commands

Middleware has the ability to register named commands with Neutrino. These registered commands are also available to
invoke from the CLI provided the middleware registering the command has been loaded when it is time for the CLI to
invoke the command.

```js
// custom.js
module.exports = (neutrino) => {
  neutrino.register('hello', () => 'HELLO WORLD!');
};
```

```bash
❯ neutrino hello --use custom.js
HELLO WORLD!
```

## Exit codes

When the CLI creates an instance of Neutrino, it waits for all commands to either resolve or reject their registered
command. If the command succeeded, the CLI will exit with code `0`. If there were errors, the CLI will log the errors
to the console and exit with code `1`. This makes it easier to use Neutrino commands for status reasons, such
as failing a pull request on continuous integration if any tests fail or if there are linter errors.
