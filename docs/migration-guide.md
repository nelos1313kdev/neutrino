## Neutrino v7 to v8

Neutrino v8 introduces a number of changes, with some of them being breaking changes. To upgrade from Neutrino v7
to v8, be sure to check this list for tasks you may need to perform to use this latest version:

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Middleware and preset packages have been migrated and scoped under the new
[@neutrinojs](https://www.npmjs.com/org/neutrinojs) organization. See [Migrated Packages](#migrated-packages)
for the full list of deprecated packages and the new scoped packages to migrate to. The core `neutrino` package
remains available as is.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** Removed `entry` option in order to support multiple main entry points via new `mains` options.
See [Customization](./customization.md#optionsmains) for usage of `mains` in
`.neutrinorc.js`. See [API](./api.md#optionsmains) for usage of `mains` from the API.
([#487](https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev/pull/487))
- **BREAKING CHANGE** `*.css` files in mains chunks are no longer inlined into the JS bundle by default.
They are moved into a separate CSS file. To disable CSS extraction, pass `options.extract = false` to
the style-loader middleware, or `options.style.extract = false` to the web preset.
([#443](https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev/pull/443))
- **BREAKING CHANGE** There is no longer a plugin named `minify` when using the `minify` middleware. This is due
to the `minify` middleware now being a composition of three different middleware. The associated plugins are
`babel-minify`, `style-minify`, and `image-minify`, from their associated individual middleware, which can also be
used separately.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** The Karma preset now uses Headless Chrome by default to run tests. To that end,
you will need Chrome 60+ installed. ([#283](https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev/pull/283))
- **BREAKING CHANGE** The API methods `.call()` and `.run()` no longer accept additional middleware to load
prior to running their registered handler. If you wish to load middleware prior, use the `.use()` method first.
Also, these methods no longer automatically load `.neutrinorc.js` either, you must load this using `.use()` as well.
([#425](https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev/pull/425))
([#424](https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev/pull/424))
For a concrete example, `.eslintrc.js`, which utilizes these changes, would migrate to the following:

```js
const { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');

module.exports = Neutrino({ root: __dirname })
  .use('.neutrinorc.js')
  .call('eslintrc');
```

- **BREAKING CHANGE** When building, `file-loader` and `url-loader` will generate file names with pattern
`[name].[hash].[ext]` instead of `[hash].[ext]`. ([#435](https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev/pull/435))
- **BREAKING CHANGE** The web preset no longer uses the `script-ext` plugin. It was never functional and did not
serve a purpose at this time. ([#500](https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev/pull/500))

## Neutrino v6 to v7

Neutrino v7 introduces some changes, most of which are from major version bumps of dependent packages.
To upgrade from Neutrino v6 to v7, be sure to check this list for tasks you may need to perform to use
this latest version:

- **BREAKING CHANGE** webpack-chain upgraded to v4. The breakage from this upgrade is the `.noParse` method
which is now a plain shortcut method, allowing you to set any value.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** webpack upgraded to v3. While most users should need no changes for this upgrade, be
aware that it may still be possible for something to change during this upgrade.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** The Web and React presets no longer include babel-polyfill by default, and have removed
the `polyfill.babel` option. If you need babel-polyfill in your app, please import it.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** ESLint has been upgraded to v4, which may bring linting configuration
changes.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** The Neutrino `static` option has been removed. The Web, React, and Node.js presets will
still copy files from a `src/static` directory if it exists, but you can override your own
copying directives using the `neutrino-middleware-copy` middleware.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** Certain processes like minification or starting the dev server used to happen during many
different values for the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. These are now controlled to run during
certain `NODE_ENV` values like `production` or `development`, or when using certain commands like
`start` or `build`. Look at the documentation for your specific presets to determine what environments or
commands are used for certain configuration changes.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** The minify plugin has switched to using the BabelMinifyWebpackPlugin, so the middleware
options have been renamed from `babili` to `minify` and from `overrides` to `plugin`,
e.g. `neutrino.use(minify, { minify: {}, plugin: {} })` or `['neutrino-middleware-minify', { minify: {}, plugin: {} }]`.

## Neutrino v5 to v6

Neutrino v6 introduces a number of changes, with some of them being breaking changes. To upgrade from Neutrino v5
to v6, be sure to check this list for tasks you may need to perform to use this latest version:

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Neutrino overrides and configuration is no longer done from package.json, but can automatically
be picked up in a `.neutrinorc.js` file. If you want to leave your configuration in package.json until
you migrate completely to the RC file, put the following contents in your `.neutrinorc.js` file:

```js
const pkg = require('./package.json');

module.exports = {
  options: pkg.neutrino.options || {},
  use: [
    ...(pkg.neutrino.use || []),
    neutrino => neutrino.config.merge(pkg.neutrino.config || {})
  ]
};
```

See the documentation on `.neutrinorc.js` for more details on overriding configuration.

- **BREAKING CHANGE** The Web and React presets no longer include a polyfill for `Buffer`. This saves approximately 60KB
of polyfills from being loaded, at the expense of using the `Buffer` constructor. If you need the `Buffer`
constructor or a dependency relies on it, you can override the configuration in `.neutrinorc.js`:

```js
neutrino.config.node.set('Buffer', true)
```

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Neutrino no longer relies on `HOST`, `PORT`, and `HTTPS` environment variables for overriding
the webpack-dev-server settings, respectively. You can choose to either override these from `.neutrinorc.js` or
a one-off basis using CLI options:

```js
// Override a preset/middleware:
module.exports = {
  use: [
    ['neutrino-preset-react', {
      devServer: {
        host: '192.168.1.10',
        port: 3000,
        https: true
      }
    }]
  ]
};
```

```js
// Override all presets:
module.exports = {
  options: {
    host: '192.168.1.10',
    port: 3000,
    https: true
  }
};
```

```bash
# Override from CLI
neutrino start --options.host 192.168.1.10 --options.port 3000 --options.https
```

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Setting `host` of `0.0.0.0` for webpack-dev-server is insecure and will not work properly. This
is from https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/887 causing a potential security issue into webpack
users' machines. When using `host`, specify your actual local IP address, and Neutrino will bind it to the `public`
property of webpack-dev-server and set the host to `0.0.0.0` for you. Attempting to access the site from a host other
than specified will result in an invalid host header error.

Should you absolutely need to access the site from any potential host, for example if behind a proxy or firewall,
override from `.neutrinorc.js`:

```js
// Override a preset/middleware
module.exports = {
  use: [
    ['neutrino-preset-react', {
      devServer: {
        disableHostCheck: true
      }
    }]
  ]
};

// Override configuration
neutrino.config.devServer.disableHostCheck(true)
```

- **BREAKING CHANGE** The chunk middleware no longer includes a plugin named `"chunk"`, and instead exposes several
plugins which handle different chunking mechanisms: `named-modules`, `named-chunks`, `vendor-chunk`, `runtime-chunk`,
and `name-all`.

- **BREAKING CHANGE** With the changes in chunk middleware, there is no longer a named-modules middleware for v6 since
this now comes with the chunk middleware.

- **BREAKING CHANGE** All non-JS assets within your source directory are not automatically copied to the output
directory. A new Neutrino option for `static` now specifies a directory for all non-compiled/included assets, and this
defaults to `src/static`. For example, if you wanted to include some images into the build that are not `import`ed into
your project, you can place them in `src/static` and they will be automatically copied to `build/static`.

- **BREAKING CHANGE** The `run` function from Neutrino's exports has been removed in favor of a `run` method on the API.

- **BREAKING CHANGE** The `build`, `start`, `test`, and `inspect` functions from Neutrino's exports no longer
instantiate the Neutrino API, but are now functions that are passed to the Neutrino API's `run` method. For example, to
run the `build` function, you can pass it via:

```js
const { Neutrino, build } = require('neutrino');

Neutrino()
  .run('build', [middleware], build)
  .fork(errorHandler, successHandler);
```

See the [Neutrino API](./api.md) for details on the updated API.

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Since the Neutrino API has changed, creating a `.eslintrc.js` file has also changed. If you have
your middleware defined in `.neutrinorc.js`, your `.eslintrc.js` file can be as simple as:

```js
module.exports = require('neutrino/src/api')().call('eslintrc');
```

For a more verbose example version without `.neutrinorc.js`:

```js
const { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');
const api = Neutrino();

module.exports = api.call('eslintrc', ['neutrino-preset-airbnb-base', 'neutrino-preset-react']);
```

**BREAKING CHANGE** An empty object is no longer passed as options to middleware if no options have been specified.

**Dependency potential BREAKING CHANGES:**

  - `babel-core` upgraded to v7.0.0
  - `file-loader` upgraded to v0.11.2
  - `file-loader` removed from `html-loader` middleware, switched to `html-loader`
  - `babili-webpack-plugin` upgraded to v0.1.1
  - `css-loader` upgraded to v0.28.4
  - `style-loader` upgraded to v0.18.2
  - `jest` upgraded to v20.0.3
  - `react-hot-loader` upgraded to v3.0.0-beta.7
  

- Async polyfills are now using fast-async instead of Babel's regenerator. The reasoning is explained in the
[fast-async README](https://github.com/MatAtBread/fast-async):

> 'fast-async' is a Babel v6.x.x plugin that implements the ES7 keywords async and await using syntax transformation
at compile-time, rather than generators. The main reason for using 'fast-async' as opposed to Babel's default
implementation of async/await is performance (https://github.com/MatAtBread/nodent#performance) - it's 3-4 times faster
in a browser/node, and as much as 10 times faster on a mobile browsers, mainly due to avoiding generators
(and therefore regenerator).

If you wish to disable the fast-async polyfill, you can specify it to the Web, React, and Node.js presets from
your `.neutrinorc.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  use: [
    ['neutrino-preset-web', {
      polyfills: { async: false }
    }]
  ]
};
```

- The React preset is now additionally Babel-compiled with `transform-class-properties`, and during `development` also
includes `transform-es2015-classes` to work around https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/313.

- The Node.js preset, start-server middleware, and babel-preset-env in any middleware can be debugged with the `--debug`
CLI flag or the Neutrino option `debug`.

- The Node.js preset now compiles Babel to support Node.js LTS which has moved to v6.10 from v6.9.

- Babel compiles using a `cacheDirectory` to improve subsequent build times.

- The Neutrino API now exposes generic `prerun` and `run` events which are triggered prior to at any command
running, e.g. running `neutrino build` will trigger a `prebuild`, `prerun`, `build`, and `run` events.

- The ESLint middleware now defaults to a `development` NODE_ENV if none is specified.

- Configuration can now more easily be overridden based on the values of environment variables from `.neutrinorc.js`
using the `env` property. Each property within `env` maps to an environment variable with key-values mapping to 
environment values which contain further middleware. This works for any environment variable, not just `NODE_ENV`.
For example, if you wanted to include additional middleware when `NODE_ENV` is `production`:

```js
module.exports = {
  env: {
    NODE_ENV: {
      production: {
        use: ['neutrino-middleware-pwa']
      }
    }
  }
};
```

## Neutrino v4 to v5

Neutrino v5 introduces a number of changes, with some of them being breaking changes. To upgrade from Neutrino v4
to v5, be sure to check this list for tasks you may need to perform to use this latest version:

- Updates to config for creating plugins (from webpack-chain v3 upgrade):

```js
// Creating plugins in v4
neutrino.config
  .plugin(name)
  .use(WebpackPlugin, ...args)

// Creating plugins in v5
neutrino.config
  .plugin(name)
  .use(WebpackPlugin, args)
```

- Updates to config for modifying plugins (from webpack-chain v3 upgrade):

```js
// Modifying plugins in v4
neutrino.config
  .plugin(name)
  .inject((Plugin, args) => new Plugin(...newArgs))

// Modifying plugins in v5
neutrino.config
  .plugin(name)
  .tap(args => newArgs);
```

- Updates to config for creating loaders (from webpack-chain v3 upgrade):

```js
// Creating loaders in v4
neutrino.config.module
  .rule('compile')
  .loader('babel', 'babel-loader', {
    options: {
      plugins: ['your-babel-plugin']
    }
  });

// Creating loaders in v5
neutrino.config.module
  .rule('compile')
  .use('babel')
    .loader('babel-loader')
    .options({ plugins: ['your-babel-plugin'] });
```

- Updates to config for modifying loaders (from webpack-chain v3 upgrade). The function now gets its options directly
instead of being nested in an object:

```js
// Modifying loaders in v4
neutrino.config.module
  .rule('compile')
  .loader('babel', props => merge(props, {
    options: {
      plugins: ['your-babel-plugin']
    }
  }));

// Modifying loaders in v5
neutrino.config.module
  .rule('compile')
    .use('babel')
      .tap(options => merge(options, { plugins: ['your-babel-plugin'] }));
```

- Updates to `include` and `exclude` for rules (from webpack-chain v3). In the previous webpack-chain
package, `include` and `exclude` were functions where you provided paths as arguments. These are now
`ChainedMap`s, making them much more extensible should you need to manipulate these values:

```js
// Adding rule includes and excludes in v4
neutrino.config.module
  .rule('compile')
    .include(x, y)
    .exclude(x, y);

// Adding rule includes and excludes in v5
neutrino.config.module
  .rule('compile')
    .include
      .add(x)
      .add(y)
      .end()
    .exclude
      .add(x)
      .add(y);

// You can also use .merge() to add multiple paths at once:
neutrino.config.module
  .rule('compile')
    .include.merge([x, y]).end()
    .exclude.merge([x, y]);
```

- Simple configuration via package.json now done from top-level `neutrino` object. Rename `config` to `neutrino`, and
rename `config.neutrino` to `neutrino.config`. Presets also fall under this `neutrino` object. The `custom` object has
been renamed to `options`.

```json
{
  "neutrino": {
    "config": {
      "entry": {
        "vendor": ["react"]
      }
    },
    "use": [
      "neutrino-preset-react"
    ],
    "options": {
      "mocha": {
        "reporter": "nyan"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- The Web preset has renamed its styling rule from `css` to `style`:

```js
// v4 API for Web preset
neutrino.config.module.rule('css')

// v5 API for Web preset
neutrino.config.module.rule('style')
```

```json
{
  "neutrino": {
    "config": {
      "module": {
        "rule": {
          "style": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- The Neutrino CLI has renamed `--presets` to `--use` to better reflect the usage of middleware and presets, and to
make the inclusion of middleware consistent with the API at `neutrino.use()`.
- Jest upgraded to v19, which changes the option `testPathDirs` to `roots`. Jest options set using
package.json can now only be done at `neutrino.options.jest` (no more package.json `jest`);
- Linting base is deprecated in favor of `neutrino-middleware-eslint`:

```js
// v4 API
const lint = require('neutrino-lint-base');

lint(neutrino);
neutrino.config.module
  .rule('lint')
  .loader('eslint', props => merge(props, { rules: { /* */ } }));

// v5 API
const eslint = require('neutrino-middleware-eslint');

neutrino.use(eslint, {
  eslint: {
    rules: { /* */ }
  }
})
```

- When using a linting preset or consuming anything with `neutrino-middleware-eslint`, the `eslintrc()` method has been
moved from `neutrino.custom.eslintrc` to `neutrino.eslintrc`:

```js
// v4 API
neutrino.custom.eslintrc();

// v5 API
neutrino.eslintrc();
```

- The default export of the Neutrino package is now an object with several methods, one of these being the low-level
Neutrino API:

```js
const { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');
```

- The Neutrino API has undergone significant changes and no longer needs to be called as a constructor with `new`.

- The Neutrino API no longer accepts preset strings as its argument. The function now accepts an options object to
be set at `neutrino.options`:

```js
const { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');
const api = Neutrino({ mocha: { reporter: 'nyan' } });

api.options.mocha.reporter // "nyan"
```

- Since the Neutrino API no longer accepts preset strings in its constructor, you must now pass presets and middleware
as code/functions to the `.use()` method.

```js
// v4 API
const Neutrino = require('neutrino');
const api = new Neutrino(['neutrino-preset-node', 'neutrino-preset-mocha']);

// v5 API
const { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');
const api = Neutrino();

api.use(require('neutrino-preset-node'));
api.use(require('neutrino-preset-mocha'));
```

This also means the API function no longer does preset module resolution. If you wish to require presets and middleware
and have them simultaneously `use`d, use `requiresAndUses`:

```js
// v5 API
const { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');
const api = Neutrino();

api.usesAndRequires([
  'neutrino-preset-node',
  'neutrino-preset-mocha'
]);
```

- `neutrino.getWebpackOptions()` has been removed in favor of the lower level to `neutrino.config.toConfig()`.
- Using a `node` target no longer skips the watcher for a builder, it now uses the webpack source watcher. This means
commands like `neutrino start && node build` are obsolete. `neutrino build && node build` would work to start a Node
instance for production-built bundles.
