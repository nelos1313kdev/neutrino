Think Webpack, but with presets. That's Neutrino.

Neutrino is a companion tool which lets you build web and Node.js applications with shared
presets or configurations. It intends to make the process of initializing and building projects
much simpler by providing minimal development dependencies. Neutrino uses Webpack to build both
web and Node.js projects by providing complete build presets which can be shared across targets and
projects. You can use Neutrino base presets to get started building a variety of projects, create your
own presets by extending the Neeutrino core presets to be shared across your own projects or even by the
community. Presets can even be manipulated on a project-by-project basis to handle almost any build
situation your preset doesn't cover.
